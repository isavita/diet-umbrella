              " Welcome to my village kitchen from Bangladesh. I am Halima, and I invite you to my cosy kitchen in Crouch End, for a traditional Bangladeshi family style meal with a of wonderful vegetables and lentils to go with a base of basmati rice. Growing up in a big family, food was always an important part of my life. Travelling to Bangladesh in recent years, I fell in love with the local ways of cooking and built a menu of all my favourite dishes. I will throw in a handful of appetizers while you challenge your friends to Jenga or Audition, but first, Gin&Tonic please. I&#39;m offering a night of party, complimentary drink, typical Bangladeshi food, and a introduction to its tradition. Be prepared for good food, laugh, cheers and new friends. Appetizers: Fuska /samosas/ shingaras with salad and sauce. Main: Dal - lentils Kochur loti - taro roots & split peas Begun - aubergine & bean seeds Aloo bhaji - potatoe stir fry With pilau rice Desserts: Fruits & vermicelli pudding with coconut milk. ",

              " When you come on our food tours in London, you’ll get to try many famous British foods, all guaranteed to get your taste buds tingling. Firstly, your local London guide take you to the exciting Borough Market to soak up the atmosphere and eat some English fudges/chocolate. This eating paradise was not even on the tourist foodie radar a few years ago. Still around the market, you will try award winning Lincolnshire sausages followed by the best and most fresh fish and chips in town (and you will get to see the difference between ‘chips’ and ‘French fries’). There is so much to see in the market that your guide will give you 10-20 mins to look around yourselves, giving you a chance to buy gifts or eat any samples. Your personal guide will explain the history of the market and the sounding areas including the Sir Walter Raleigh’s Golden Hind, the Shard and Southwark Cathedral. Your tour will continue to a historic pub where you can try the best of British cheeses, served with grapes, fig cakes and chutneys. Washed down with real London Beers, Ales, or delicious ciders (or non-alcoholic options). You’ll also see the world famous London Bridge and Tower Bridge on the River Thames and also the Battleship HMS Belfast. Finally, the tour ends with classic desserts, such as cheese cakes, chocolate brownies or treacle sponge pudding all washed down with a pot of refreshing tea Oh, and of course there’s our delicious Secret Dish too!

              " Join us for an intimate tour of our brewery. There will be a maximum of 8 people on the tour. We will talk you through the brewing process, explain how Wild Card Brewery came about and how we create our signature beers. After the tour you will be given four half pints of our core range and a tutored tasting. Not only that, but you get a chance to taste some food that we&#39;ve matched with our beers. We will also give you a glass and hand-outs explaining: the brewing process, the history of Wild Card Brewery and how to taste beer and pair it with food so you can try it at home. There will of course be an opportunity to stock up on beers for the rest of the weekend after the tour! FAQs Are there ID requirements or an age limit to enter the event? To drink the beer you will need to be 18.  What are my transport/parking options getting to the event? Parking is available outside the brewery.   ",
